A mango fell from a tree into a jaguar’s paws. It was late summer. The  jaguar devoured the fruit and ran into the ocean. The ocean was turquoise like the August sky. The jaguar swam underwater for a few minutes. It smiled beneath the waves.
Later, clouds began to form. The sun became veiled by the clouds; it began to rain. The jaguar swam a little bit more, but then exited the water. It walked back to the jungle for twenty minutes in the rain. When the jaguar arrived on its turf, it climbed up a tree and fell asleep. The moon looked like a summer mango.
