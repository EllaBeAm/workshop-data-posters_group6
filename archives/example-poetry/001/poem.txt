A jaguar sat in a tree. It was midsummer. The sun was shining fiercely. The jaguar was a golden color with plenty of brown spots. Then the ghost of Emiliano Zapata walked by. He was in full uniform, with rifle and sword, but in black-and-white. He looked like a cloud.
The jaguar leapt from the tree and walked up to Zapata’s ghost. The jaguar  genuflected in General Zapata’s direction. Zapata pulled out his sword and knighted the jaguar. “From this day forward, this noble jaguar will be called Cuauhtémoc Xochipilli,” he said. The sun faded and set. It began to rain.
